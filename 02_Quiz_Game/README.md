# Quiz Game – Python Mini Project

This is a simple command-line quiz game built using Python.  
The user answers multiple-choice questions, and the program keeps track of
the score and displays the final result at the end.

This project was created to practice working with data structures and
control flow while building a complete interactive program.

## How the Game Works
- A list of questions, options, and correct answers is stored in the program
- Each question is displayed one by one
- The user selects an option (A/B/C/D)
- The program checks the answer and updates the score
- The final score is shown after all questions are completed

## Concepts Used
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops and conditional statements
- User input handling
- Basic validation and scoring logic

## How to Run
```bash
python quiz_game.py

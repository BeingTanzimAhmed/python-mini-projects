# Typing Speed Tester – Python Mini Project

This is a command-line typing speed tester built using Python. The user is
asked to type a randomly selected sentence, and the program measures typing
speed and accuracy.

This project focuses on working with time measurement, string comparison,
and basic performance calculations.

## How It Works
- A sentence is randomly selected from a predefined list
- The user types the sentence as quickly as possible
- The program records the time taken
- Typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy are calculated
- Results are displayed to the user

## Concepts Used
- Time module
- Random module
- Functions
- String operations
- Basic mathematical calculations

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to practice combining multiple concepts
such as timing, string handling, and logic into a single working program.

## How to Run
```bash
python typing_speed_tester.py

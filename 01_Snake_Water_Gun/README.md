# Snake Water Gun – Python Mini Project

A simple command-line game built using Python where the user plays Snake,
Water, or Gun against the computer.

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to practice
basic logic, conditionals, and user interaction by building a complete
working program instead of isolated examples.

## How It Works
- The computer randomly selects Snake, Water, or Gun
- The user enters their choice
- The program decides the winner based on game rules
- The result is displayed as win, lose, or draw

## Concepts Used
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Random module
- User input handling

## How to Run
```bash
python snake_water_gun.py
